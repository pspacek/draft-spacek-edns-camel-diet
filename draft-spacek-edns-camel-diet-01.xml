    <abstract>
	    <t>DNS responders must either follow RFC 6891 by fully implementing EDNS or at least respond to queries containing OPT record according to older specifications.
		    Non-compliant implementations which do not respond at all are not worth talking to.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
    <t>
	    Neither the original DNS standard RFC 1035 nor its extensions RFC 2671 and RFC 6891 allow not to respond to a DNS query.
	    Many years later non-compliant implementations which drop queries still exist and cause lot of extra queries, latency, and complicated logic in recursive resolvers. The cost of supporting these non-compliant implementations keeps increasing.
    </t>
      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="The Protocol">
	    <t>No DNS response message to a repeated DNS query containing EDNS extension implies that the other side is not a DNS responder. The querier MUST NOT retry its query without EDNS.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Instruction to follow EDNS standard does not change security properties beyond what is written in RFC 6891.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>This has no effect on privacy of DNS.</t>
